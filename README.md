from the original "Pay What Feels Good" ([pwfg](http://lightward.com/pwfg)) text:

> We have this theory, this feeling, that an economy made of this kind of arrangement would Just Work. We think it would result in balance, and peace. We can't prove that, and we recognize that we're speaking from our specific corner of the world. But still, this feels right.

since locating the pay-neutral ([pn](http://lightward.com/pn)) strategy a bunch of years later, it seems like what we're talking about is the intelligence of what we might call "the worldspace" in its gestalt as an ecosystem. for comparison see managed computing's concept of "userspace", though "agentspace" might be better if we're talking about a component agent experiencing its world.

a successfully self-developed worldspace is "aesthetically stunning and structurally efficient" (which is what my golden ratio forearm tattoo anchors for me)

successful self-development of a worldspace relies on its component agents switching out of the exit row "if you're unable or uncomfortable" with those duties, because in a rapidly emergent context "unable" and "uncomfortable" are the same thing from the perspective of a worldspace that needs you to act responsively (not responsibly, *responsively*) for the safety of the worldspace and its component agents. agent movement in a worldspace is a sort of generativity-sort, then? answering the immediate question: is the exit row a privilege? ... in the sense that moderator privileges are privileges, I guess, yes?

what looks like an agent's intelligence from the outside is, I think, coherent improvisation among the population of component agents on the inside. which only sometimes looks like overall improvement (in the way that Grandi's series is only sometimes positive), but, the more periods of self-recognition, the more the agent knows itself.

worldspace-as-[eigenbearer](https://eigenbearer.is/), agent-as-eigenbearer, agentspace as the private-but-entangled workspace of the agent within its world

does that work?

(answer: I guess it depends how you're summing Grandi's series?)
